    "In the previous two chapters we considered **classification** and **clustering** algorithms, which aim to separate observations into two or more groups by predicting a discrete label (e.g. \"0\", \"1\", \"2\"). The goal of these  **Regression** problems, on the other hand, aim to predict the value of a continuous variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, in the two previous chapters the machine learning algorithm output was a predicted value *y*, where *y* was a [categorical variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_variable), and we used the term \"labels\" to refer to the different values of that variable. In this chapter, we will consider the case where *y* is a [continuous variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_or_discrete_variable#Continuous_variable). The term \"label\" is not appropriate when *y* is continuous because *y* has an infinite number of possible values.\n",

    "This chapter considers two types of machine learning regression algorithms:\n",
    "* Nearest Neighbors (NN) Regression\n",
    "* Support Vector Machine (SVM) Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "A wide variety of other regression algorithms exist, including some that we discussed in early chapters. A summary of regression possibilities in **sklearn** is described in its [supervised learning documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html#supervised-learning).\n",
