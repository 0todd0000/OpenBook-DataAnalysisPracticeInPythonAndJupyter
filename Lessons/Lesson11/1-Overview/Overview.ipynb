    "Unlike [classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification), which is a form of [supervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning), and which we considered in the previous chapter, [clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis)\" is a form of [unsupervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning).\n",

    "The key differences between supervised and unspervised learning are:\n",

    "* Supervised learning:  target values (e.g. labels) are **known**\n",
