    "[XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) is a text-file format that is similar to HTML, but there are two important differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "* <span style=\"color:blue\">**HTML files are meant for web brosers.**</span> They have a rigid format, and only specific element types can be used to ensure that web browsers can interpret them.\n",
    "* <span style=\"color:blue\">**XML files store arbitrary data**</span>. They have a much freer format, and programmers develop a specific XML format for specifc needs. XML files are usually not renderable in web browsers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, HTML files can be regarded as a specific type of XML file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyone can create any XML format for any purpose. The basic XML syntax is identical across files, making XML parsers able to read them, but the actual structure of the XML file varies substantially from dataset to dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to its flexibility, the XML format is more common than CSV for complex datasets. <span style=\"color:red\">XML is a very common data format</span>, in science, engineering, and many other applications. Many websites use XML to dynamically store and update data (e.g. retail websites).\n",
