    "This chapter considers how appropriate **preprocessing** can help to improve machine learning (ML) results.  **Preprocessing** refers to a variety of data processing steps that occur *before* the data are submitted to an ML routine like K-Nearest Neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Preprocessing routines can be very important because certain ML algorithms are optimized for data with particular characteristics. As a simple example, an ML routine might work best when all features are transformed to the range -1 to +1. To optimize ML performance, it is essential to both:\n",
